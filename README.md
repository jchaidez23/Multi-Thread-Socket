# Multi-Thread-Socket
The given task was to create a program that would allow the transfer of data between a server and client(s). 
This task was accomplished using C to create both the server and client files and then using TCP/UDP protocols 
to allow the exchange of information. This project was developed as a small prototype to how communication 
can be accomplished using socket programming and networking principles.
